Dear Me. 	,

I know you are doing well. I had fun discusion on Career Focused Project together on Tuesday. I know we agreed that I would make a PowerPoint presentation, but I donï¿½t have any way to save my work after each session. 
Could you please remind me to bring a jump drive to next session?

I am also interested in learning the importance of teamwork at your job. What do you think makes someone an effective team player in the workforce? lets discuss it in our next session.

Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions and I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely, 
Payal
